# Riddlesticks

Send someone an encrypted message that can be unlocked with the answer to a riddle.

## About
This came about from a desire to send a riddle with a reward, as a means of play with a partner that was far away. I built a tool specific for this purpose, and then thought others might like to use it. Here it is!

The neat thing about this, is that the resulting message and riddle come in a single file. They are not saved on a server anywhere. They are generated client side, in the browser, and downloaded for sharing. 

Once the riddle is solved, the message is revealed.

## Current considerations
- Should we provide a server so that riddles can be stored and shared via secret urls? This feels a little counter to the point, but would allow it to work better on mobile.

## Collaboration
I'm totally down. Let me know if you have a proposed change you'd like to implement.
